CodeReview
==========

Create a code review website where developers can upload/write their code and get it reviewed by others from the same industry. Will be similar to stack overflow except for the fact that instead of being a Q&amp;A website, this will be a review website where members can provide insights to others code. 

Idea Behind:
The idea behind code reivew is to provide an online platform for developers to post their code for the public to view. Each posted code will be in the form of Q&A where all signed in members can view the code and provide reviews on it.
